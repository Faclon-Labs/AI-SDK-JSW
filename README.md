## Quick Start

Run the setup wizard to quickly configure your development environment:

```bash
./setup_wizard.sh
```

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Git
- Node.js and npm (for Angular/React)
- Python 3.x and pip (for Python)

### setup Options

The setup wizard offers two connector types:
- **UserID-based connector**: Authentication using user IDs
- **Token-based connector**: Authentication using tokens

You can also choose to include demo applications to help you get started quickly.

## Framework Support

1. Angular
2. React
3. Python

## Development Workflow

1. **setup Environment**: Run the setup wizard to configure your environment
   ```bash
   ./setup_wizard.sh
   ```

2. **Explore the Code**: Familiarize yourself with the repository structure

3. **Enter the demo app** (if installed):
   ```bash
   cd demo- {PressTab}
   ```
4. **Run Demo App** (if installed):
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```
5. **Develop Your Application**: Integrate the SDK components into your app

6. **Test Your Integration**: Ensure all features work as expected

7. **Build for Production**: Create optimized production builds

## Production Readiness

### Important: Cookie Management for UserID Authentication

⚠️ **CRITICAL FOR PRODUCTION**: When using the UserID-based connector, you must properly configure cookie management to ensure secure authentication:

1. **Cookie Reading Implementation**: Applications must read the `userID` cookie to retrieve the authenticated user ID.

   ```javascript
   // Example code for reading cookies in JavaScript
   function getCookie(name) {
     const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
     const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
     if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift();
   }
   
   // Get the iosense user ID
   const userID = getCookie('userID');
   ```

2. **Cookie Expiration**: Ensure your application properly handles cookie expiration and refresh processes.

3. **Security Considerations**:
   - Use the `secure` and `httpOnly` flags for cookies in production
   - Implement proper CSRF protection
   - Consider using SameSite cookie attributes

4. **Testing**: Thoroughly test your cookie implementation in a staging environment before deploying to production.

For more details, refer to the Cookie Management section in the [official documentation](https://docs.iosense.dev/authentication/cookies).

### Pushing to Main

1. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   ```

2. Push your changes to the remote repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   ```
